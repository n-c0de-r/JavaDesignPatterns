# Observer Pattern Testing
Designing and Testing Observer/Subject &amp; Decorator patterns

This weeks lab is about learning about and implementing a few design patterns.
First one is the Observer and Subject pattern. We shall create a few shops and
shopping carts. Then we implement methods to notify each shop of a found stray
cart. Each shop keeps track of their own brand's carts as well as unknown carts
that could potentially belong to them, too.
